# WebSocket Gateway Test Suite Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite created for the WebSocket gateway implementation that uses pg-boss for job queue management with customer-specific queue prefixes.

## Test Files Created

### 1. Unit Tests

**File**: `test/unit/websocket/websocket.gateway.spec.ts`

**Coverage**:

- WebSocket connection handling with customer token authentication
- Job publishing to customer-prefixed queues (`{customerId}/{jobName}`)
- Worker registration for specific job queues
- Job status event broadcasting (started, completed, failed)
- Error handling for unauthenticated clients

**Key Features**:

- Mocked dependencies (PrismaService, PgBossService)
- Mock socket creation utilities
- Proper TypeScript typing for all test scenarios
- Tests for both success and failure scenarios

### 2. End-to-End Tests

**File**: `test/e2e/websocket.e2e-spec.ts`

**Coverage**:

- Real WebSocket connection establishment
- Authentication flow with valid/invalid tokens
- Job operations (send, batch, cancel, schedule)
- Worker registration
- Job status event handling
- Queue management operations
- Comprehensive error handling scenarios

**Key Features**:

- Real Socket.IO client connections
- Database integration with mocked PrismaService
- Full integration testing of WebSocket gateway
- Proper cleanup of connections after tests

## Test Architecture

### Dependencies

- **Jest**: Testing framework
- **@nestjs/testing**: NestJS testing utilities
- **socket.io-client**: Real WebSocket client for E2E tests
- **PrismaService**: Database access layer (mocked)
- **PgBossService**: Job queue service (mocked)

### Mocking Strategy

- **PrismaService**: Mocked for customer token lookups
- **PgBossService**: Mocked for job queue operations
- **Socket objects**: Custom mock utilities for unit tests
- **Real connections**: Socket.IO client for E2E tests

## Test Scenarios Covered

### Authentication

✅ Connection rejection without token  
✅ Connection rejection with invalid token  
✅ Connection acceptance with valid token

### Job Operations

✅ Job publishing with customer prefix  
✅ Batch job publishing  
✅ Job cancellation  
✅ Job scheduling  
✅ Error handling for failed operations

### Worker Management

✅ Worker registration for specific queues  
✅ Customer-specific queue subscription  
✅ Worker registration error handling

### Event Broadcasting

✅ Job started events  
✅ Job completed events  
✅ Job failed events  
✅ Real-time event propagation

### Queue Management

✅ Queue size monitoring  
✅ Customer-specific queue isolation  
✅ Global queue statistics

## TypeScript Compliance

Both test files have been updated to resolve TypeScript compilation errors:

- Proper typing for Socket.IO event callbacks
- Correct Prisma model interfaces with all required fields
- Elimination of `any` types where possible
- Type-safe mock implementations

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests Only

```bash
npm run test test/unit/websocket/websocket.gateway.spec.ts
```

### E2E Tests Only

```bash
npm run test:e2e test/e2e/websocket.e2e-spec.ts
```

### All Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Test Environment Requirements

### Database

- PostgreSQL database for pg-boss
- Customer tokens table for authentication
- Test customer token: `test-customer-token-e2e`

### Configuration

- WebSocket server on port 3001 for E2E tests
- pg-boss connection string
- Prisma database URL

## Code Quality

The test suite maintains high code quality standards:

- Comprehensive test coverage for all gateway functionality
- Proper setup and teardown procedures
- Clear test descriptions and assertions
- Error scenario validation
- TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Integration Points

The tests validate the complete integration between:

- WebSocket gateway and Socket.IO
- Customer authentication via Prisma
- Job queue operations via pg-boss
- Real-time event broadcasting
- Customer-specific queue isolation

This test suite ensures the WebSocket gateway implementation is robust, secure, and ready for production use.
